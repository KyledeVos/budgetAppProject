# budgetAppProject
Coding Nomads - Final Java Project

This is a back-end Budget App Project allowing a user to add, change, remove and view aspects of their personal budget including overviews and report printing. 

## Background

I wanted to create a project allowing a user to add to and track their personal finances. In addition I wanted the user to see account summary overviews and run reports 
on their finances. Use of Java LinkedLists and a SQL Database are incorporated. The idea is to populate the LinkedLists with data from the database when overviews and 
reports are selected. The program will analyse the data in the LinkedLists
